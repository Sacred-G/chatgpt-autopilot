# Changelog



## [0.4.0] 2023-07-07

### Added

- A system message for creating PowerPoint presentations using Marp
- Ability to refuse commands ChatGPT wants to run with a message to ChatGPT
- Improved cross-platform support
- Creation of a project outline in the beginning of the project. Can be skipped with `--no-outline` or used automatically with `--use-outline`
- `--git` flag to initialize a Git repository in the project automatically and commit every task. Commit message generation can be disabled with `--no-commit-msg` if you don't want to generate a commit message with GPT
- `--simple` flag for running simple prompts quickly
- `--no-cmd` flag to disable the `run_cmd` function from ChatGPT
- `--zip` flag to create a zip file of the project instead of writing files directly (`--no-cmd` is added automatically). When this flag is used, files are created only in memory and saved to a zip file in the end. An optional filename or full path of a zip file can be provided.
