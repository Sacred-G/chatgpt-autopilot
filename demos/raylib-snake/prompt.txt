## Better prompt: ##
Construct a Snake game using C language coupled with Raylib for game development. Your game should consist of the following features: Keyboard commands for snake movement, a snake that reappears from the opposite end when it hits the screen border (wrap-around effect), and the game ends when the snake collides with itself. Additionally, include a 'build.sh' script that facilitates the process of game compilation.
