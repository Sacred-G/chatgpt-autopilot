What would you like me to do?
Answer: Create a Python + JS web application with a large button "Tell a joke". When you press it, send a fetch request to an API endpoint that returns a random joke, which is shown to the user. Create the API endpoint inside the Python application and add 5 random jokes to it. The API should load the jokes from a JSON file, so that the JSON file can later be edited to add or remove jokes. Create a Dockerfile and a docker-compose.yml for the project so that the application can be run with docker-compose up -d. Add a README.md file that describes how to run the service with Docker
