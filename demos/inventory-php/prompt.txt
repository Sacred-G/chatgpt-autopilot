What would you like me to do?
Answer: I need an inventory system to track the stock amounts of my products and their total prices. Create a PHP application that has a form for adding a new product name, quantity and price to the inventory. Save the products to a JSON file. List all the products in the inventory in a table. Calculate and show the total price of all the products. Add CSS styles so that the application looks professional and production-ready. Make the product addition form disappear when you print the page.
