What would you like me to do?
Answer: I need an inventory system to track the stock amounts of my products and their total prices. Create a browser-based javascript application that has a form for adding a new product name, quantity and price to the inventory. List all the products in the inventory in a table. Calculate and show the total price of all the products. Add CSS styles so that the application looks professional and production-ready. Make the product addition form disappear when you print the page.

There are no files in the project yet. Let's start by creating the required HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. We will create a HTML file for the structure of your application, a JavaScript file for the functionality and a CSS file for styles. Starting with the HTML file:

1. It will contain a form with input fields for the product name, quantity, and price.
2. It will have a table to display all added products with their quantity and price.
3. An area will be provided to display the total price of all products.
4. The form will be hidden when printing the page by using a CSS print media query.

The `index.html` file is now created and contains the basic structure of your inventory system. Now, let's proceed to write the required JavaScript code. The JavaScript code will:

1. Get the form and table elements from the DOM.
2. Add an event listener to the form to prevent the default form submission behaviour and handle the product addition.
3. Create a product object from the form data and append a new row to the table with this product information.
4. Calculate the total price from all the products in the table and update the total price area.
```

Now, the `app.js` file is ready. The functionality of the inventory system has been set up with the JavaScript file.

The final step is to create a CSS file to style our HTML. The CSS will make the application visually appealing and ensure the product addition form is hidden during printing.

What do you want to ask?
Answer: save the products to localstorage so that they persist over page reloads
FUNCTION: Reading file code/app.js...
## ChatGPT Responded ##
```
To persist the products over page reloads we can use the localStorage API in the browser. We need to update our JavaScript code as follows:

1. When a product is added, we should save it to an array that is stored in localStorage.
2. When the page is loaded, we should load the products from localStorage and display them in the table.

Let's implement these steps.
